Must have list

http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2014/03/top-10-most-beautifully-designed-apps.html omg they’re so question
1.  Book Recommendation Algorithm(Backend-JS/JQuery)
* User inputs favorite genre, three favorite books, etc(on second page of website).
* After this, computer will recommend like twenty books. 
* Will give books not to read as well. 
* If you click a book, there’s a specific book format.
1. Keyword (Same algorithm(might have slight modifications depending on UI)this one is more specified)
* Need  a number of different keywords
* Needs user to press keywords
* Keywords ned to correspond with tags given to books
* Must give back a list of books
* Different from Book Recommendation because here, the user can pick a book depending on what they want to read at the specific time. 
    2 ½. Be able to click the book and see info
1. Current Reads List
2. Browse Books (Depends on API)
3. Rating to help algorithm
4. Calendar to organize reading schedule
 
Proposal!


Problem: 
- often times people find it difficult to find books to read next
- most websites do not have accurate recommendation systems in which books are based on ratings or are not specific enough
- focus more on recommendations for user and have a more simple and modern look


Solution:
- implement a search based on keywords/tags that can either be based on previous books user has read or a specific search of tags (8tracks format)


Implementation:
- Backend:JavaScript/Jquery
- UI: HTML, CSS
- API: Internet (Google Books?)


Design Documents
Use Case:
- To utilize Book Recommendation Algorithm based on book title inputted by user:
1. Display input section where user can type in book titles of recent books read or ones they liked        
2. User presses submit button once done inputting books
3. A search of books based on the tags each book inputted has is done and a list of most similar books is generated
        4. Display recommendation list 


Components:
Book database, Tag/Search system to generate recommendations
- First Page/Survey
* Input Bars of preferred book titles
* Submit Button → conducts search
* Display of recommendation list
* Do not read list
- User Search 
* Display of all keywords books are tagged with
* User can select a few of these keywords 
* User presses submit button → conducts search
* Display of result list based on books that contain selected keywords


Risk Assessment:
- Book recommendations may not be the most accurate as tag system may be difficult to implement
- API will be difficult to choose so it will take longer than expected to create the back-end functions of our app
-Using the tag system to make recommendations might be a huge component that can take a lot of time. 


Possible API
* Google Books: https://developers.google.com/books/?csw=1
* GoodReads
* Barnes and Noble Price Retriever
